## 📘 Overview

**LicenseChain** is a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) designed to modernize the issuance, lifecycle management, and verification of digital licenses. By leveraging the **Ethereum blockchain** for immutability and **IPFS** for decentralized storage, LicenseChain eliminates centralized inefficiencies, mitigates fraud, and ensures transparent, tamper-proof license management.

This project demonstrates the practical application of blockchain technology in real-world **governance and regulatory systems**.

## 🧩 System Architecture & Core Features

### 🏛️ Administrative Authority (Governance Layer)
- Secure issuance of licenses using smart contracts  
- Immutable on-chain audit trail for approvals, renewals, and revocations  
- IPFS-based decentralized storage for license metadata and documents  

### 👤 Applicant Portal (User Layer)
- React-based interface for license applications  
- Smart contract-driven automated renewals  
- Self-sovereign license ownership via MetaMask wallets  
- Real-time blockchain-backed license status tracking  

### 🔍 Public Verification Layer
- Trustless license verification using License ID or Registration Number  
- Global visibility of revoked or expired licenses  
- No intermediary dependency for verification

## 🚀 Application Workflow

1. Applicants submit license requests through the frontend  
2. Administrators review and issue licenses via governance smart contracts  
3. License data is stored immutably on Ethereum, with metadata on IPFS  
4. Third parties verify licenses through the public verification portal
